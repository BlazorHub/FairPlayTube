# Coding Standards

Here you will find some documentation on the coding standards to follow for this specific project.

## No harcoded values
We are actively trying to avoid the use of hardcoded values spread all around the code, instead, we have used the approach of a Constants class, 
in the Common project, any constant value needs to have a constant defined in some of the subclasses.
